## Speckle Server Helm Charts

This Helm chart bundles all Speckle developed components of the Speckle server deployment.
Please note that data storage and persistence requirements of the app are not installed by the chart, as these are external dependencies. The required dependencies are listed in our deployment [dependencies](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-manualsetup.html#dependencies) page.

### Usage

A full guide to deploying on Kubernetes can be found in [Speckle's Documentation](http://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup-k8s.html), we recommend that you follow this guide if you are new to Kubernetes or Helm.

The below are brief notes which will require [additional dependencies](http://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup-k8s.html#step-2-optional-deploy-dependent-external-services) and configuration.

#### Pre-requisite

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

#### Instructions

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```shell
$ helm repo add speckle https://specklesystems.github.io/helm
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.
You can then run `helm search repo speckle` to see the charts.

To install the speckle-server chart:

```shell
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace speckle-test my-speckle-server speckle/speckle-server
```

where `my-speckle-server` will be the name of the Helm release.

More details about the values to configure for your release can be found in [Speckle's Documentation](http://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup-k8s.html#step-4-configure-your-deployment)

By default the chart will install in the `speckle-test` namespace, that name can be set in the chart values.

#### Uninstalling

To uninstall the chart:

```shell
$ helm uninstall my-speckle-server --namespace speckle-test
```

Depending on the Infrastructure on which Speckle was released, a load balancer may have been created.  This may have to be manually deleted.

### Network Plugin configuration

This is used to define the type of network policy that is deployed.
Different Kubernetes Network Plugins or Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) can make use of different types of
Network Policy.  Some of these provide more features than the standard Kubernetes Network Policy.

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                 | Value        |

### Ingress metadata for NetworkPolicy

This section is ignored unless networkPolicy is enabled for frontend or server.
The NetworkPolicy uses this value to enable connections from the ingress controller pod in this namespace to reach Speckle.

### Monitoring

This enables metrics generated by Speckle to be ingested by Prometheus: https://prometheus.io/
Enabling this requires Prometheus to have been deployed prior, as this resource expects the Prometheus Customer Resource Definition
for the ServiceMonitor to already be existing within the cluster.
